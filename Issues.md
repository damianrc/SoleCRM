# Issue Log: What‚Äôs Fixed and What Remains

## ‚úÖ Fixed Issues
- **JWT Security**: Short-lived access and refresh tokens are implemented, with automatic rotation and revocation. Token validation and error handling are improved.
- **Input Validation**: Zod is used for schema-based validation on all endpoints. Centralized validation middleware is present.
- **Rate Limiting**: `express-rate-limit` is implemented with granular and progressive limits for different endpoints.
- **Helmet Security**: CSP, HSTS, XSS, frame options, and MIME sniffing protections are explicitly configured.
- **Prisma/DB Inefficiencies**: Queries use `select`/`include` properly, with optimized pagination and reduced N+1 issues.
- **Frontend State Management**: React Query is used for all server state; authentication state is centralized; error boundaries are in place.
- **File Structure/Modularity**: Middleware and utilities are organized; validation and rate limiting are centralized.
- **Error Handling**: Centralized error handling middleware is present; error responses are consistent.
- **Environment Security**: Environment variable templates and secure JWT config are documented.
- **Performance**: Query and memory optimizations are implemented; frontend token and cache management improved.

## üü° Still To Do / Partially Addressed
- **Testing**: No evidence of automated unit/integration/e2e tests (Jest, React Testing Library, Supertest) in the codebase. Only manual testing is documented.
- **Prettier, Husky, lint-staged**: No config or scripts found for these tools.
- **TypeScript**: Some dependencies and references exist, but the codebase is still JavaScript.
- **CI/CD**: No GitHub Actions or other CI/CD pipeline detected.
- **Monitoring**: No Sentry or LogRocket integration found.
- **API Documentation**: Not present.
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Not fully implemented.
- **Automated Security Scanning/Audit Logging**: Not found.
- **Performance Monitoring**: Not found.
- **Feature-First Structure**: Some improvements, but not fully adopted.
- **Dead Code/Unused Dependencies**: No automated process found for removal.
- **Bootstrap/Lucide**: Both are still present; consider tree-shaking or removal if not needed.
- **CSS-in-JS**: Not implemented; still using CSS modules and Bootstrap.
- **README/Onboarding**: Basic setup docs exist, but could be expanded for onboarding and code standards.

1. Major Issues
Backend Security Gaps

JWT: If you‚Äôre not using short-lived tokens and refresh tokens, you‚Äôre at risk for token theft.
Helmet: Default config is not enough; CSP, HSTS, and XSS protections may need explicit setup.
No mention of input validation (e.g., express-validator or zod), which leaves you open to injection attacks.
No rate limiting (e.g., express-rate-limit)‚Äîvulnerable to brute force and DoS.
Prisma/DB Inefficiencies

If you‚Äôre not using Prisma‚Äôs include/select properly, you risk N+1 queries.
Poor schema normalization or lack of indexes can kill performance at scale.
Frontend State Management

If you‚Äôre mixing React state and TanStack Query for the same data, you‚Äôll get bugs and unnecessary re-renders.
Overuse of context or prop drilling can hurt performance and readability.
File Structure/Modularity

If you have ‚Äúservices‚Äù, ‚Äúutils‚Äù, ‚Äúcomponents‚Äù, ‚Äúpages‚Äù, ‚Äúapi‚Äù all at the root, it can get messy fast.
Too many levels of abstraction (e.g., ‚Äúatoms‚Äù, ‚Äúmolecules‚Äù, ‚Äúorganisms‚Äù) can be overkill for a CRM.
Testing

No mention of automated testing (unit, integration, or e2e). This is a major risk for regressions.
2. Suggested Improvements
Backend

Add input validation middleware (e.g., zod, joi, or express-validator).
Implement rate limiting on auth and sensitive endpoints.
Use short-lived JWTs and refresh tokens; store refresh tokens securely (e.g., HTTP-only cookies).
Centralize error handling (middleware) and use consistent error responses.
Audit Prisma queries for N+1 issues; use include/select and batch queries where possible.
Frontend

Use React Query for all server state; avoid duplicating with local state.
Memoize expensive components and use React.memo/useMemo/useCallback where needed.
Use lazy loading (React.lazy, Suspense) for routes and heavy components.
Consider moving to CSS-in-JS (e.g., styled-components, vanilla-extract) if you need dynamic theming, but CSS Modules are fine for most use cases.
Architecture

Adopt a ‚Äúfeature-first‚Äù folder structure: group files by feature/domain, not by type.
Separate API layer (fetchers) from UI logic.
Use a consistent naming convention for files and variables.
Tooling

Add Prettier for code formatting.
Add Husky + lint-staged for pre-commit hooks.
Add scripts for DB migrations, seeding, and test runs.
3. Unnecessary or Redundant Code/Libraries
Bootstrap: If usage is minimal, consider removing and replacing with your design system.
Lucide Icons: If you only use a few icons, tree-shake or import only what you need.
Unused Utility Functions/Components: Regularly audit for dead code.
Over-abstracted Components: Avoid ‚Äúwrapper hell‚Äù and unnecessary HOCs.
4. General Advice on Code Quality and Maintainability
Comments: Prefer self-explanatory code and clear naming over excessive comments.
Types: If not using TypeScript, consider migrating for better safety and DX.
Design System: Keep it minimal and document usage. Avoid over-engineering.
Documentation: Maintain a clear README and onboarding docs.
Consistent Error Handling: Both frontend and backend should have predictable error shapes.
5. Tools or Patterns to Add
Testing: Add Jest (unit), React Testing Library (frontend), and Supertest (backend).
Monitoring: Add Sentry or LogRocket for error tracking.
API Validation: Use zod or joi for schema validation.
Rate Limiting: Use express-rate-limit.
TypeScript: Strongly consider for both frontend and backend.
CI/CD: Add GitHub Actions or similar for lint/test/build on PRs.
Env Validation: Use envalid or zod to validate environment variables at startup.
Final Thoughts
Prioritize a feature-based folder structure and keep abstractions pragmatic.
Remove unused dependencies and code regularly.
Add automated tests and pre-commit hooks ASAP.
Harden your API with validation, rate limiting, and secure JWT practices.
Document your design system and keep it lean.
